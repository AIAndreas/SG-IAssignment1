A intermediate p will resemble the small world phenomenon of random networks, as the wiring of the edges will be more random and not only focus on the k-nearest neighbours. At p=1 we see that the average shortest path length increase significantly from p=0.1, this would indicate a futher reduction in the clustering. In other words, at p=1 for the Watt-Strogatz random network it will fully neglect the characteristc of wiring to close neighbours, but instead  choosing uniformly at random to wire an edge to any node in the network. This will naturally result in shorter paths as the network becomes more intertwined."
