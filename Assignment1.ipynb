An intermediate $p$ will resemble the small world phenomenon of random networks, as the wiring of the edges will be more random and not only focus on the k-nearest neighbours. At $p=1$ we see that the average shortest path length increase significantly from $p=0.1$, this would indicate a futher reduction in the clustering. In other words, when $p=1$, the network will fully neglect the characteristc of wiring to close neighbours, but instead  choose uniformly at random to wire an edge to any node in the network.

Each performer was added as a node, with their word count stored as a node attribute. We then scraped the performer text file for links, and if a link matched another performer in our dataset, we added it as a directed edge. Finally, we removed isolated nodes and extracted the largest weakly connected component. \n",
