As an example, a random network could not replicate the properties of a social network, as there would be no highly popular person, or someone with zero friends (outliers).

An intermediate $p$ will resemble the small world phenomenon of random networks, as the wiring of the edges will be more random and not only focus on the k-nearest neighbours. At $p=1$ we see that the average shortest path length increase significantly from $p=0.1$, this would indicate a futher reduction in the clustering. In other words, when $p=1$, the network will fully neglect the characteristc of wiring to close neighbours, but instead  choose uniformly at random to wire an edge to any node in the network. This will naturally result in shorter paths as the network becomes more intertwined."
